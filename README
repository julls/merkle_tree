Learning about Merkle Trees and Rust by implementing a very simplified version in C++ && Rust.
Avoiding using real hashing functions, since the focus is to learn about the implementation of the merkle tree.

C++: 
cd cplusplus
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake ..
make
./merkle_tree_tests

Rust:
cd rust-impl
cargo build
cargo test -- --nocapture
